 * When making a request, a Promise is returned that resolves when the action has run and the result is available.
 * Furthermore, requests are retried a number of times if they do not succeed at first.
 *
 * The requests queue variables:
 *
 *   - queueOrder: contains references to items in queuedRequests in the order in which they should be executed.
 *   - queuedRequests: contains request IDs in sequential order, but not necessarily from index 0.
 *   - readyRequests: keys are request IDs, values are a boolean that is true if the request is allowed to run.
 *     Only one request is allowed to run at a time.
 *
 * Lastly, performingRequest is true if a task is running, false if no request is running.
