Callisto Discord bot
====================

My bot, a good boy.


Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

* [Node 8.1.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) or higher
* A [Discord API key](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)

Node can be easily installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or via your package manager.

### Setup

This project is a monorepo managed via [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/), which should be installed globally first. To install dependencies, run Lerna's bootstrap command:

    lerna bootstrap

After that, you should be able to run the bot:

    ./start.js

This will start the bot and allow it to start responding to user input in the channels you've invited it to.
